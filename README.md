This is a realization of a Hamming (8,4) code for error detection and correction. It defines functions Hamming84_encode to encode a 4-bit data into an 8-bit Hamming code and Hamming84_decode to decode the received code, detect errors, and correct if possible using parity bits. The main function demonstrates encoding and decoding a sample data sequence, showing the error detection and correction capabilities of the Hamming (8,4) code.
